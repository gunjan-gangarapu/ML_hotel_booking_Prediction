# 🏨 Hotel Booking Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict hotel booking cancellations based on various features such as booking date, lead time, number of guests, meal preferences, and more. It uses Python and machine learning algorithms to make accurate predictions.

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a predictive model that classifies whether a hotel booking will be **canceled** or **not**, helping hotel managers take proactive decisions.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains booking details from a hotel over time including:

- Customer type
- Booking dates
- Number of adults and children
- Lead time
- Meal type
- Market segment
- Reserved room type
- Special requests
- and more...

> ✅ The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed before modeling.
